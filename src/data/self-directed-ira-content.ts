        "Generally, any individual with earned income or existing retirement funds to roll over can open a self-directed IRA. No business ownership is required.",

      question: "How much can I contribute?",

        "Annual IRA contribution limits are set by the IRS and apply across all your IRAs combined, regardless of how many accounts you hold. Your exact limit depends on your age and income.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I take a loan from my IRA?",
      answer:
        "No. Unlike a 401(k), IRAs do not permit loans. Early withdrawals may trigger taxes and penalties outside of specific exceptions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I roll over an old 401(k) or IRA?",
      answer:
        "In most cases, yes. Funds from a former employer's plan or an existing IRA can typically be rolled into a self-directed IRA without triggering taxes or penalties, when done correctly.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is checkbook control?",
      answer:
        "Some self-directed IRA structures, like an IRA-owned LLC, let you write checks or wire funds directly for an investment without routing each transaction through a custodian.",
    },
    {
      question: "May I hold IRA metals personally?",
      answer:
        "No. IRA-owned precious metals must be held by the custodian or an approved depository — taking personal possession is treated as a distribution and can disqualify the account. The team reviews storage requirements before a metals purchase.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Roth Academy hold my assets?",
      answer:
        "No. Roth Academy is not a custodian. A qualified trustee or custodian holds the account's assets; the team coordinates the setup, paperwork, and provider relationship around that arrangement.",
